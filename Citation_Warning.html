        _____________________________________________________ <br /><br />

        Judicial Council of California Form<br />
        Rev. 09-20-05 (Veh. Code, §§ 40500(b), 40513(b), 40522, 40600; Pen. Code, § 853.9)<br />
        SEE REVERSE<br />
        TR-130<br />
        _________________________ REVERSE SIDE _________________________<br /><br />

        IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY<br /><br />

        WARNING: If you fail to appear in court as you have promised, you may be arrested and punished by 6 MONTHS IN
        JAIL
        AND/OR A $1,000 FINE regardless of the disposition of the original charge. (Veh. Code, § 40508 or Pen. Code, §
        853.7.) In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided by law may be deemed to have elected to have a
        trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged
        infraction,
        as charged by the arresting/citing officer.<br /><br />

        JUVENILE: If you were under age 18 at the time the citation was issued, you must appear in court with your
        parent
        or guardian.<br /><br />

        COURTESY NOTICE: A courtesy notice may be mailed to the address shown on your citation, indicating the required
        deposit of money (bail) that may be forfeited instead of your appearing in court. If you do not receive such
        courtesy notice, you are still required to comply with the items below by the appearance date.<br /><br />

        WHAT TO DO<br />
        You are required to appear at court for a misdemeanor violation. For all violations, your court date/time/place
        are on the front of this notice to appear. Have the citation with you when contacting the court. In all
        infraction
        cases, you must do one or more of the following for each violation:<br /><br />

        - Pay the fine (Bail).<br />
        - Appear in court.<br />
        - Contest the violation.<br />
        - Correct the violation (traffic cases, when applicable).<br />
        - Request traffic school (traffic cases, when applicable).<br />
        - Request trial by written declaration (traffic cases).<br /><br />

        If you do not do one of the above actions, then a "failure to appear" charge will be filed against you (Veh.
        Code,
        § 40508(a)) and your driver license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged
        an
        amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency. (Pen. Code, §
        1214.1.)<br /><br />

        1. If you do NOT contest the violation:<br /><br />

        a. (Pay the bail amount) Contact the court for bail information. You will not have to appear in court. You will
        be
        convicted of the violation, and it will appear on your record at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). A point
        count may be charged to your DMV record, and your insurance may be adversely affected.<br /><br />

        b. (Traffic school) You may be able to avoid the point count by completing traffic school. You must pay the bail
        amount as a fee, and you may have to pay other fees. Contact the court to request traffic school.<br /><br />

        c. (Correctable violations) If the "Yes" box is checked on the front of your ticket, the violation is
        correctable.
        Upon correction of the violation, have a law enforcement officer or an authorized inspection/installation
        station
        sign below. (Veh. Code, § 40610.) Registration and driver license violations may also be certified as corrected
        at
        an office of the DMV or by any clerk or deputy clerk of a court. The violation will be dismissed by the court
        after PROOF OF CORRECTION and payment of a transaction fee are presented to the court by mail or in person by
        the
        appearance date. Violations under Vehicle Code section 16028 (automobile liability insurance) will be dismissed
        only upon (1) your showing or mailing to the court evidence of financial responsibility valid at the time the
        notice to appear was issued, and (2) your payment of a transaction fee.<br /><br />

        CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION (MUST BE RETURNED TO COURT)<br /><br />

        Section(s) Violated:<br />
        Signature of Person Certifying Correction:<br />
        Serial No.:<br />
        Agency:<br />
        Date:<br /><br />

        2. If you contest the violation (select a or b):<br /><br />

        a. (Court trial) Send a written request or a check or letter postmarked not later than five days prior to the
        appearance date on your citation or by the appearance date to request a court trial on a future
        date.<br /><br />

        b. (Trial by written declaration (traffic infractions)) Send a certified or registered letter postmarked not
        later
        than five days prior to the appearance date or come to the court on or before the appearance date to request a
        trial by written declaration. Submit the bail amount. You will be given forms to allow you to write a statement
        and to submit other evidence without appearing in court. An officer will also submit a statement. The judicial
        officer will consider the evidence and decide the case.<br /><br />

        Make check/money order payable to Clerk of the Court. Write your citation number and driver license number on
        your
        check or money order. You may pay in person, by mail, or by phone.<br /><br />

        If "Booking Required" is checked, you must appear for booking on a weekday prior to your court date at:
        ________________ between the hours of ___ and ___, and bring the signed verification to your court appearance.
        Call ________________ for more information.<br /><br />

        Booking Verification: I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that
        ________________ was booked on ________<br /><br />

        THE MESSAGE IS SIMPLE:<br /><br />

        - Lock It: Always lock your vehicle when unattended and secure valuables in the trunk.<br />
        - Hide It: If your car doesn't have a trunk, store valuables under the seats, in the glove box, or other
        compartments.<br />
        - Keep It: Taking personal responsibility is the best way to protect your property and prevent
        theft.<br /><br />

        TIPS TO AVOID BECOMING A VICTIM:<br /><br />

        - Fully close all windows.<br />
        - Never leave your vehicle running unattended.<br />
        - Use a steering wheel lock.<br />
        - Remove all valuables and store shopping bags in the trunk.<br />
        - Keep GPS devices, iPads, iPods, laptops, and other electronics out of sight.<br />
        - Park in well-lit areas and avoid isolated spots.<br />
        - Install a car alarm system.<br />

        - Ensure oncoming traffic is clear before making a left turn.<br />
        - Always wear a seatbelt to prevent serious injuries or fatalities.<br />
        - Pull over to the right when emergency vehicles approach with lights and sirens. Do not stop in the middle of
        the
        roadway.<br />

        - Avoid using a cell phone while driving.<br /><br />

        - Use caution when crossing—do not assume you have the right of way.<br /><br />

        TIPS FOR BICYCLISTS:<br /><br />

        - Wear reflective clothing and protective gear (helmet, eye protection, etc.).<br />
        - Riding on sidewalks makes you less visible to cars.<br />
