On November 4, 2008, the People of the State of California approved Proposition
9, the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law. This measure amended the
California Constitution to provide additional rights to victims. This card contains
specific sections of the Victims’ Bill of Rights and resources. Crime victims may obtain
additional information regarding Marsy’s Law and local Victim Witness Assistance
Center information by contacting the Attorney General’s Victims’ Services Unit at

A ‘victim’ is defined under the California Constitution as “a person who suffers direct
or threatened physical, psychological, or financial harm as a result of the commission
or attempted commission of a crime or delinquent act. The term ‘victim’ also
includes the person’s spouse, parents, children, siblings, or guardian, and includes
a lawful representative of a crime victim who is deceased, a minor, or physically or
psychologically incapacitated. The term ‘victim’ does not include a person in custody
for an offense, the accused, or a person whom the court finds would not act in the
best interests of a minor victim.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 28(e).)
