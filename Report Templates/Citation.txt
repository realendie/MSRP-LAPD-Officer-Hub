IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY  


WARNING: If you fail to appear in court as you have promised, you may be arrested and punished by 6 MONTHS IN JAIL AND/OR A $1,000 FINE regardless of the disposition of the original charge. (Veh. Code, § 40508 or Pen. Code, § 853.7.) In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided by law may be deemed to have elected to have a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40903(a) upon any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer.  


JUVENILE: If you were under age 18 at the time the citation was issued, you must appear in court with your parent or guardian.  


COURTESY NOTICE: A courtesy notice may be mailed to the address shown on your citation, indicating the required deposit of money (bail) that may be forfeited instead of your appearing in court. If you do not receive such courtesy notice, you are still required to comply with the items below by the appearance date.  


WHAT TO DO  
You are required to appear at court for a misdemeanor violation. For all violations, your court date/time/place are on the front of this notice to appear. Have the citation with you when contacting the court. In all infraction cases, you must do one or more of the following for each violation:  


- Pay the fine (Bail).  
- Appear in court.  
- Contest the violation.  
- Correct the violation (traffic cases, when applicable).  
- Request traffic school (traffic cases, when applicable).  
- Request trial by written declaration (traffic cases).  


If you do not do one of the above actions, then a "failure to appear" charge will be filed against you (Veh. Code, § 40508(a)) and your driver license may be withheld, suspended, or revoked. In some courts, you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency. (Pen. Code, § 1214.1.)  


1. If you do NOT contest the violation:  


a. (Pay the bail amount) Contact the court for bail information. You will not have to appear in court. You will be convicted of the violation, and it will appear on your record at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). A point count may be charged to your DMV record, and your insurance may be adversely affected.  


b. (Traffic school) You may be able to avoid the point count by completing traffic school. You must pay the bail amount as a fee, and you may have to pay other fees. Contact the court to request traffic school.  


c. (Correctable violations) If the "Yes" box is checked on the front of your ticket, the violation is correctable. Upon correction of the violation, have a law enforcement officer or an authorized inspection/installation station sign below. (Veh. Code, § 40610.) Registration and driver license violations may also be certified as corrected at an office of the DMV or by any clerk or deputy clerk of a court. The violation will be dismissed by the court after PROOF OF CORRECTION and payment of a transaction fee are presented to the court by mail or in person by the appearance date. Violations under Vehicle Code section 16028 (automobile liability insurance) will be dismissed only upon (1) your showing or mailing to the court evidence of financial responsibility valid at the time the notice to appear was issued, and (2) your payment of a transaction fee.  


CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION (MUST BE RETURNED TO COURT)

2. If you contest the violation (select a or b):  


a. (Court trial) Send a written request or a check or letter postmarked not later than five days prior to the appearance date on your citation or by the appearance date to request a court trial on a future date.  


b. (Trial by written declaration (traffic infractions)) Send a certified or registered letter postmarked not later than five days prior to the appearance date or come to the court on or before the appearance date to request a trial by written declaration. Submit the bail amount. You will be given forms to allow you to write a statement and to submit other evidence without appearing in court. An officer will also submit a statement. The judicial officer will consider the evidence and decide the case.  


Make check/money order payable to Clerk of the Court. Write your citation number and driver license number on your check or money order. You may pay in person, by mail, or by phone.
